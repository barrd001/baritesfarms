          <h3>Livestock Heal the Soil</h3>
          <p>
            For thousands of years, millions of herbivores migrated across the
            grasslands of the earth, spurred on by packs of predators who
            followed them. These creatures cut down the grasses and weeds as
            they fed as well as crushing and grinding the leftovers into the
            ground under their tremendous weight while fertilizing with their
            droppings. This simple act of nature fed the earthworms, fungi, and
            other organisms and created some of the most fertile soils on Earth.
          </p>
          <br />
          <p>
            Today we strive to mimic nature with holistically managed, pastured
            miniature cattle, poultry, and no till farming to improve our soils
            and in an effort to reverse desertification.

          <h3>Food that Heals the Body</h3>
          <p>
            The food we eat has a huge effect on our bodies and our health.
            Healthcare costs have skyrocketed in the US and much of this can be
            considered a by-product of Industrial Factory Farming. Cows, pigs,
            chickens, and all other manner of animal are overstocked in huge
            feed barns and lots where they live in their own feces and urine,
            passing around bacteria that are getting stronger and stronger as
            their "caretakers" pump these animals full of hormones and
            antibiotics.
          </p>
          <br />
          <p>There is a better way...</p>
          <br />
          <p>
            Our livestock live outside, in nature where they belong. They are
            not confined to the same space day after day which allows them to
            avoid the pathogens one sees in Industrial farms. Our cows, goats,
            and sheep are followed a few days later by the chickens who will
            scratch through the pasture, loosening and aerating the soil. This
            process not only helps to sanitize the pasture but also spreads the
            natural fertilizer and feeds the soil biology. All of this allows us
            to raise our animals without antibiotics or other medications or
            additives and results in milk, meat and eggs which are better for
            you and more nutritionally dense then what you find in the store.

          <h3>Experience Heals the Soul</h3>
          <p>
            Animals and nature tend to be very soothing, almost therapeutic for
            many people. We provide an opportunity for US Veterans, many of whom
            have seen things others cannot understand, to come and learn about
            our processes here. There is a healing quality to caring for other
            living beings, be it livestock or plants. We are a place where
            fellow Veterans can come and unwind, blow off steam, and learn. We
            are happy to have the lone Veteran or their family come to stay on
            the Ranch. We want to give Veterans the tools to start their own
            homestead, farm, or even to come and work with us permanently on
            Barites Veteran Ranch. We hope to heal the cracked souls of our
            fellow Veterans and help them find a future in a world that is often
            difficult for us to adjust to.
